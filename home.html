<h2 style="font-size:50px;"> History of Dogs&#128054;</h2>

<div>Dogs are believed to have been domesticated from wolves between 20,000 and 40,000 years ago. 
    This process likely began when wolves scavenged near human camps, and the friendlier, less aggressive individuals formed a symbiotic relationship with humans. Early humans benefited from dogs' hunting and guarding skills, while dogs gained a steady food source and protection. 
    As societies evolved, so did the roles of dogs. Different breeds emerged based on their tasks, including herding, hunting, guarding, and companionship. Remains of early domesticated dogs have been found in various archaeological sites around the world, indicating their presence in ancient cultures.
    Throughout history, dogs have been bred for specific functions, leading to a wide variety of breeds. This includes sled dogs in Arctic regions, herding dogs on farms, and hunting dogs in forests.</div>
